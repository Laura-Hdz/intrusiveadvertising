        <p>How often do you browse free-content websites that don’t use advertising as a means of revenue? How often do you find websites that turn you off because of their poorly placed banners ads and annoying pop-ups? Intrusive advertising has become an unfortunate trend for publishers to use in order to increase their profits and keep their websites alive. The Coalition for Better Ads defines intrusive advertising as ads that disrupt user experience, interrupt the content on a page and/or slow down browsing and loading.</p>
        <p>According to a survey of around 1000 people done by HubSpot, 91% agreed that ads have become more intrusive than they were 2-3 years ago, yet 83% agree that not all ads are bad but that there needs to be a way to filter the obnoxious ones. A majority of people believe that ads “being displayed now are not compelling—they are deceptive, intrusive and disruptive.” In fact, most people who click on online ads do so on accident or were deceived by the content of the ad, rather than because they are interested or attracted by the ad itself. This provides insight on the fact that it is the “annoying” ads, such as pop-up and autoplaying ads, that have truly become a problem in the world of online advertising.</p></div>
